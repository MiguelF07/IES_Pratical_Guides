**A little summary of what is Maven** ⬇️

Maven helps in project management. This tool helps in building and documenting the project.
Maven is a build tool, and build tools are needed for the following processes:

* Generating source code
* Generating documentation from the source code
* Compiling of source code
* Packaging of the compiled codes into JAR files
* Installing the packaged code in a local repository, server or central repository

Maven is based on the Project Object Model (POM).

**What is POM?**

POM is an XML file that has all the information regarding project and configuration details. It also includes the plugins used by Maven in the project.

So, to sum up, Mavel is used to **build and manage any Java-based project.**

**Why do we need Maven?**

Maven allows us to:

* Get the right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.
* Download dependencies from mvnrepository.com. We no longer need to download the dependencies visiting their official website.
* Create the **right project structure**, which is essential for execution.
* Build and deploy the project to make it work..
* Easy access to all the required information.
